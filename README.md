# Phyton files
  **Step-profile Optical Fiber class (OFiber_class.py):**

  The object catch the main characteristics of a step-profile optical fiber. The notation is
  from Snyder&Love book is followed ("Optical Waveguide Theory", A.W. Snyder 
  and J. Love Springer, Boston, MA (1983) 1st Ed 
  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-2813-1).)
  
  It includes:
  - Eigenvalue equations and cuttoff expressions (Table 12-4)
  - Field components of the exact modes (Table 12-3)
  - Modal properties of the step-profile fiber (Table 12-5)

   **EM fields class (OFiber_fields.py):**

   Snyder&Love: Section 12-8 Table 12-3 Field components of all the modes.
   Class EMfield inherits class OFiber as a means to have simple access to the 
   electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic fields and the quantities necesary to define them are implented in OFiber class.

   **OFiber_plot.py and OFiber_find.py:**

   Methods to find the solution of the Optical Fiber dispersion relation.
   Specific methods for plotting the results.

+ Plot dispsersion relation either as: $U$ vs $V$, $\omega (eV)$ vs $\beta(\mu m^{-1})$ and $\lambda (nm)$ vs $\beta(\mu m^{-1})$.

+ Two examples are provided: 
 - High index contrast optical fiber ($n_{co}$ >> $n_{cl}$) to compare with Fig. 12-4 Snyder & Love (see fig12-4_Snyder_Love.csv)
 - Weak guidance example ($n_{co}$ â‰ˆ $n_{cl}$) to compare with Fig. 14-4 Snyder & Love (see weak_fig14-4_Snyder_Love.csv)
